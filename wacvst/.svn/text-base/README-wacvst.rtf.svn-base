\
wrapit.cpp: The MacOS X VST plugin source. This file creates a RemoteVstClient which will dispatch the various plugin requests to the\
RemoteVstServer. Resources/config.plist specifies the dll that will be started by RemoteVstServer.\
\
remotevstclient.cpp: A modified version of the code that ships with dssi-vst. This file defines RemoteVSTClient which inherits from\
RemotePluginClient. RemoteVSTClient first starts a VST server by forking\
wine which then starts dssi-vst-server. After the client has started the server, RemotePluginClient opens up the client side IPC mechanisms which\
are used to forward requests to the server and handle the results that are returned.\
\
dssi-vst-server.cpp: A modified version of the code that ships with dssi-vst. This code is started using wine. It loads the Windows VST dll. It then waits for commands via IPC mechanism, forwards them to the plugin dll and then sends the result back to the client.\
\

\b Building
\b0 :\
\
Download and install wine.\
\
Build the server from command line:\
  make \
\
Download vst2.4sdk from Steinberg\
\
Open wacvst Xcode project\
\
Point the aeffectx.h file in wacvst to the file shipped with the VST sdk.\
\
Edit config.plist to reflect path to wine and name of Windows dll to be wrapped.\
\
Build wacvst project\
\
Copy Windows vst dll and any support files to wacvst.vst/Contents/Resources\
\
One may need to copy support dlls to wine's windows\\system32 directory.\
\

\b Running
\b0 :\
\
If using the precompiled binary:\
  Edit wacvst.vst/Contents/Resources/config.plist  to reflect path to wine and name of Windows dll to be wrapped.\
\
  Copy Windows vst dll and any support files to wacvst.vst/Contents/Resources\
\
  One may need to copy support dlls to wine's windows\\system32 directory.\
\
From minihost:\
  ./minihost wacvst.vst. This is very useful for debugging.\
\
From Live:\
   move wacvst.vst to ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST\
   Start live\
   Problems can be debugged by starting Live from a command line:\
        /Applications/Live .../OS X/Live.app/Contents/MacOS/Live\
